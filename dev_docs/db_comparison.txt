PostgreSQL - Very strict about ensuring data is valid before inserting/updating
             ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is strict as well.
MySQL - Could change SQL mode to ensure data integrity, but any MySQL client could override this.
        ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is not guaranteed.

PostgresSQL - Superior for a single server  (which is what i assume we will be working with)
MySQL - Superior in replication

PostgresSQL is object relational which could be useful.
MySQL tends to be easier to work with.

MySQL isn't the best at concurrency (read-write wise)
PostgresSQL tends to scale well for concurrency
